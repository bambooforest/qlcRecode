WALS recoding
=========

**Examples of how to use qlcRecode with WALS data**

A simple example using the **qlcRecode** library with the WALS data (http://wals.info). The original data is downloaded into *sources* and recoded by the files in *scripts*. The resulting recoded data is saved into *data*. Also added are two quick visualisations of the relationship between the characteristics, as computed with **qlcMatric**.
